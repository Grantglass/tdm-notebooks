<p>Welcome to Machine Learning as a part of the 2021 TAP Institute’s summer courses. In this first day notebook, we will go over the core concepts of machine learning and start to get our feet wet with. I will not be providing you a complete overview, but rather a quick way to get a genereal understanding about what machine learning is and how it works. In days two and three, we will be exploring different machine learning techniques more in depth.</p>

<p>Head to the Google Teachable Machine Website: <a class="reference external" href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com">https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com</a></p>
<p>The Teachable Machine website provides an easy to use interface for training image, sound, and pose classification models. No login is required to get started. Training data files can be loaded directly from your computer or from your computer’s webcam or microphone. Models can be exported to use in other projects, and the FAQ (<a class="reference external" href="https://cloud.google.com/inclusive-ml/">https://cloud.google.com/inclusive-ml/</a>) includes links to read more about fairness and inclusion in ML.</p>
<p>Take a look at this project involving training a model to detect how ripe a piece of fruit is: <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;warronbebster/teachable-machine-tutorial-bananameter-4bfffa765866">https://medium.com/&#64;warronbebster/teachable-machine-tutorial-bananameter-4bfffa765866</a></p>
<p>How do you think the computer figures out ripeness?</p>
<p>What exactly are we teaching the machine?</p>
<p>What other humanistic data could we use for this type of machine learning?</p>

<h2>Part One - What is MACHINE LEARNING?<a class="headerlink" href="#part-one-what-is-machine-learning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The field itself: ML is a field of study which harnesses principles of computer science and statistics to create statistical models. These models are generally used to do two things:
Prediction: make predictions about the future based on data about the past
Inference: discover patterns in data</p>
<p>Difference between ML and AI: There is no universally agreed upon distinction between ML and artificial intelligence (AI). AI usually concentrates on programming computers to make decisions (based on ML models and sets of logical rules), whereas ML focuses more on making predictions about the future.
They are highly interconnected fields, and, for most non-technical purposes, they are the same.</p>

<div class="section" id="part-two-what-is-a-statistical-model">
<h2>Part Two - What is A STATISTICAL MODEL?<a class="headerlink" href="#part-two-what-is-a-statistical-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Models:</strong> Teaching a computer to make predictions involves feeding data into machine learning models, which are representations of how the world supposedly works. If I tell a statistical model that the world works a certain way (say, for example, that two story homes are more expensive than one story homes), then this model can then tell me what be more expensive, a ranch style home or a cape cod.</p>
<p>What does a model actually look like? Surely the concept of a model makes sense in the abstract, but knowing this is just half the battle. You should also know how it’s represented inside of a computer, or what it would look like if you wrote it down on paper.</p>
<p>A model is just a mathematical function, which is merely a relationship between a set of inputs and a set of outputs. Here’s an example:</p>
<p>f(x) = x²</p>
<p>This is a function that takes as input a number and returns that number squared. So, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 4, f(3) = 9.</p>
<p>Let’s briefly return to the example of the model that predicts home price from home stories. I may believe, based on what I’ve seen in the world, that given a home’s price is, on average, equal to the house’s stories times 100,000.</p>
<p>This model can be represented mathematically as follows:</p>
<p>Price = Stories × $100,000</p>
<p>In other words, income is a function of stories.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the main point:</strong> Machine learning refers to a set of techniques for estimating functions (like the one involving income) based on datasets (pairs of heights and their associated incomes). These functions, which are called models, can then be used for predictions of future data.</p>
<p><strong>Algorithms:</strong> These functions are estimated using algorithms. In this context, an algorithm is a predefined set of steps that takes as input a bunch of data and then transforms it through mathematical operations. You can think of an algorithm like a recipe — first do this, then do that, then do this. Done.
Machine learning of all types uses models and algorithms as its building blocks to make predictions and inferences about the world.
Now I’ll show you how models actually work by breaking them apart, component by component. This next part is important.</p>

<h2>Part Three - A Framework for understanding ML<a class="headerlink" href="#part-three-a-framework-for-understanding-ml" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Inputs:</strong> Statistical models learn from the past, formatted as structured tables of data (called <strong>training data</strong>). These datasets — such as those you might find in Excel sheets — tend to be formatted in a very structured, easy-to-understand way: each row in the dataset represents an individual <strong>observation,</strong> also called a datum or measurement, and each column represents a different <strong>feature</strong>, also called a predictor, of an observation.</p>
<p>For example, you might imagine a dataset about people, in which each row represents a different person, and each column represents a different feature about that person: profession, age, income, etc.</p>
<p>Most traditional models accept data formatted in the way I’ve just described. We call this structured data.</p>
<p>Because one common goal of ML is to make predictions, training data also includes a column containing the data you want to predict. This feature is called the response variable (or output variable, or dependent variable) and looks just like any other feature in the table.</p>
<p>Most common statistical models are constructed using a technique called supervised learning, which uses data that includes a response variable to make predictions or do inference. There is also a branch of ML called unsupervised learning, which doesn’t require a response variable and which is generally used just to find interesting patterns between variables (this pattern-finding process is known as inference). It is just as important as supervised learning, but it is usually much harder to understand and also less common in practice. This document won’t talk much about the latter subfield. The takeaway from this paragraph is simply that there are two “types” of learning, and that supervised learning is more common.</p>
<p>Model selection: We have our data, and we’ve decided that there’s probably a relationship between our predictors and our response. We’re ready to make predictions.</p>
<p>As an aside, we don’t actually need to know if there’s a relationship between these variables. We could, in fact, just throw all of our data into an algorithm and see if the resulting model is able to make valid predictions.
Now we need to pick which model to use. Naturally, there are many different types of models which explain how the data actually works, and we’d like to choose the one that most accurately describes the relationship between the predictors and the response variable.</p>
<p>Models generally fall into one of two categories:
<strong>Regression models</strong>, which are used when the response variable (i.e. the variable that you’re predicting) is continuous. For example, height, age, and income are all continuous. That is, they can be placed and ordered on a number line.
<strong>Classification models</strong>, which are used for categorical data — that is, data that doesn’t have a numerical ordering. For example, you may want to predict, based on an image of a flower, the species of that flower. Or you may want to predict whether a student is a psychology major or a math major.
The first step in picking a model is deciding whether or not your response variable is quantitative or categorical.</p>
<p>Why is model selection an important concept for non-technical people?</p>
<p>Well, if a model is chosen poorly, then its predictions will be inaccurate!</p>
<p>Below, I’ll walk you through an example of a popular, powerful, simple mode that can be used for prediction.</p>

<p>This is a text-based regression task. Every training document (a line in the data file) contains the following columns (csv format):</p>
<p><strong>id:</strong> document identifier;
original: original news headline, in which one word is tagged between &lt; and /&gt;;</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> the new word to replace the tagged word in the original headline;</p>
<p><strong>grades:</strong> a list of funniness grades (0=“Not Funny”, 1=“Slightly Funny”, 2=“Moderately Funny”, 3=“Funny”) concatenated into a single string. For instance, ‘1101’ means four human judges looked at the edited headline and submitted funniness grades {1, 1, 0, 1};</p>
<p><strong>meanGrade:</strong> the average funniness value. In the previous example, meanGrade = (1+1+0+1)/4 = 0.75 .</p>
<p>Your goal is to predict the average funniness value of an edited headline. More concretely, to predict the meanGrade (a real value) given an original headline, a tagged word, and an edit word.</p>

<p>TF-IDF ( Term Frequency(TF) — Inverse Dense Frequency(IDF) ) is a statistical measure that evaluates how relevant a word is to a document in a collection of documents. This is done by multiplying two metrics: how many times a word appears in a document, and the inverse document frequency of the word across a set of documents.</p>
<p>It has many uses, most importantly in automated text analysis, and is very useful for scoring words in machine learning algorithms for Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p>
<p>TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) was invented for document search and information retrieval. It works by increasing proportionally to the number of times a word appears in a document, but is offset by the number of documents that contain the word. So, words that are common in every document, such as this, what, and if, rank low even though they may appear many times, since they don’t mean much to that document in particular.</p>
<p>However, if the word Bug appears many times in a document, while not appearing many times in others, it probably means that it’s very relevant. For example, if what we’re doing is trying to find out which topics some NPS responses belong to, the word Bug would probably end up being tied to the topic Reliability, since most responses containing that word would be about that topic.</p>

<p>TF-IDF for a word in a document is calculated by multiplying two different metrics:</p>
<p>The <strong>term frequency</strong> of a word in a document. There are several ways of calculating this frequency, with the simplest being a raw count of instances a word appears in a document. Then, there are ways to adjust the frequency, by length of a document, or by the raw frequency of the most frequent word in a document.</p>
<p>The <strong>inverse document</strong> frequency of the word across a set of documents. This means, how common or rare a word is in the entire document set. The closer it is to 0, the more common a word is. This metric can be calculated by taking the total number of documents, dividing it by the number of documents that contain a word, and calculating the logarithm.
So, if the word is very common and appears in many documents, this number will approach 0. Otherwise, it will approach 1.
Multiplying these two numbers results in the TF-IDF score of a word in a document. The higher the score, the more relevant that word is in that particular document.</p>
