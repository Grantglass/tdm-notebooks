        "**Models:** Teaching a computer to make predictions involves feeding data into machine learning models, which are representations of how the world supposedly works. If I tell a statistical model that the world works a certain way (say, for example, that two story homes are more expensive than one story homes), then this model can then tell me what be more expensive, a ranch style home or a cape cod. \n",

        "A model is just a mathematical function, which is merely a relationship between a set of inputs and a set of outputs. Here’s an example:\n",

        "**Inputs:** Statistical models learn from the past, formatted as structured tables of data (called **training data**). These datasets — such as those you might find in Excel sheets — tend to be formatted in a very structured, easy-to-understand way: each row in the dataset represents an individual **observation,** also called a datum or measurement, and each column represents a different **feature**, also called a predictor, of an observation.\n",

There is also a branch of ML called unsupervised learning, which doesn’t require a response variable and which is generally used just to find interesting patterns between variables (this pattern-finding process is known as inference). It is just as important as supervised learning, but it is usually much harder to understand and also less common in practice. This document won’t talk much about the latter subfield. The takeaway from this paragraph is simply that there are two “types” of learning, and that supervised learning is more common.\n",

        "**Classification models**, which are used for categorical data — that is, data that doesn’t have a numerical ordering. For example, you may want to predict, based on an image of a flower, the species of that flower. Or you may want to predict whether a student is a psychology major or a math major.\n",

It works by increasing proportionally to the number of times a word appears in a document, but is offset by the number of documents that contain the word. So, words that are common in every document, such as this, what, and if, rank low even though they may appear many times, since they don’t mean much to that document in particular.\n",
